## Overview
This repository hosts a set of **audit-focused prompts** for various AI platforms (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, and more). By using these prompts, auditors can streamline tasks like **risk assessments**, **compliance checks**, and **vendor management** in a structured manner.

**Key features include:**
- A central **XLSX file** (`domain-prompts.xlsx`) storing domain, prompt, audit type, and keywords.  
- A **web interface** (via GitHub Pages) that filters and displays these prompts, allowing you to quickly find the one that best suits your scenario.  
- A **Google Form** integration for community-driven prompt submissions.

## Why Domain-Specific Prompts?
Many AI prompt collections focus on general or broad use cases. Our approach is **specialized** for auditing scenarios, delivering:
1. **High Relevance**: Auditing has unique terminology, regulations, and best practices. Domain-specific prompts yield more accurate AI responses.  
2. **Efficiency**: Pre-built prompts save time; you don’t have to craft or fine-tune from scratch.  
3. **Consistency**: Reusing proven prompts ensures your auditing workflow remains standardized and compliant.  
4. **Real-World Scenarios**: Each prompt addresses a concrete auditing need (e.g., IT security checks, business process reviews, compliance frameworks, etc.).

## Project Goals
- **Empower Auditors**: Provide a quick and reliable way to leverage AI during audit tasks, from scoping to reporting.  
- **Encourage Collaboration**: Build a community-driven repository where auditors, risk managers, and AI enthusiasts share specialized prompts.  
- **Maintain Quality**: Keep the prompts up-to-date with the latest regulations, standards, and best practices (e.g., ISO 27001, PCI-DSS, etc.).
